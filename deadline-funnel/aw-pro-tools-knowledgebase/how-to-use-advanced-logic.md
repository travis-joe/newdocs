## How to Use Advanced Logic

Advanced Logic allows you to use one Smart Link to move a subscriber to more than one list, depending on which lists they're on.

Here's an example:

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/inline/4641/4ed6bf8cf3cdd0c3d013e32922cc5013c13e049f/5b016dd458248e2ff4a1b52364e18aecaa1661ef/d2c13091f9e0a1d64c07c24c7053565d.png)

So you'll first want to create a regular Smart Link with MOVE action and more than one source list, and then you can go to Advanced Logic and create Advanced Logic for that link. If you have three source lists \(A, B, and C\), where the regular Smart Link is moving them all to List D, you might create Advanced Logic that says do that unless they're on List B, in which case move them to List G.
