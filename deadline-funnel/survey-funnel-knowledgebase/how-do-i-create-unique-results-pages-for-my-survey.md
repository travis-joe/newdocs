# How do I Create Unique Results Pages for My Survey

**At the end of your survey you have two options for results pages:**

* Survey Funnel provides a default thank you page you can use and you can customize the text that appears on this page based on a rule.
* You can redirect your respondents to an external thank you page of your choice.
