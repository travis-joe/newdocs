# GDPR

The EU General Data Protection Regulation \(GDPR\) will set a new standard for how companies use and protect EU citizens’ data. It will take effect from May 2018.

Here’s an [overview of GDPR](https://deadlinefunnel.com/gdpr), and how we are preparing for it at Deadline Funnel:

## What’s GDPR?

The EU General Data Protection Regulation \(“GDPR”\) is a new comprehensive data protection law that comes into effect on May 25, 2018. It will replace existing EU Data Protection law to strengthen the protection of “personal data” and the rights of the individual. It will be a single set of rules which govern the processing and monitoring of EU data.

## Does it affect me?

Yes, most likely. If you hold or process the data of an any person in the EU, the GDPR will apply to you, whether you’re based in the EU or not.

## How is Deadline Funnel preparing for GDPR?

Our teams have been working to define our GDPR roadmap. This is an ongoing effort to make sure we’re meeting our legal obligations, and doing the best thing for our customers while still letting us deliver the most robust and accurate deadline solution in the world.

Here are the main things we’ve been doing to ensure we’re setting up ourselves and our customers up to meet GDPR obligations:

Deadline Funnel can help you meet your data portability requirements for GDPR, you can easily export all of your data or granular subsets linked to an individual and permanently delete all data linked to an individual user.

## We’ve updated our Data Processing Agreements \(DPAs\):

Strong data protection commitments are a key part of GDPR’s requirements. [Our updated data processing agreement](https://deadlinefunnel.com/tos) shares our privacy commitments and sets out the terms for Deadline Funnel and our customers to meet GDPR requirements.

## We’ve appointed a Data Protection Officer

We’ve a dedicated Data Protection Officer to oversee and advise on our data management. Get in touch through our live chat or by emailing [help@deadlinefunnel.com](mailto:mailto:help@deadlinefunnel.com).

## We’re coordinating with our vendors

We’re reviewing all our vendors, finding out about their GDPR plans and arranging similar GDPR-ready data processing agreements with them.

We’ll keep sharing information on our progress, and we’ll also help our customers and prospective customers be compliant. Some steps you can take are:

* Get familiar with the GDPR requirements and how they affect your company.
* Map out everywhere you process data and carry out a gap analysis.
* Consider how you can leverage Deadline Funnel to help with your GDPR compliance.
* Look at your product roadmap, think about privacy when you’re planning.
* Chat to your lawyer about what your company needs to do to.
* Keep an eye on the developing guidelines from the GDPR Article 29 Working Party.
