# How to Test an Evergreen/Hybrid Campaign \(direct integration\)

## Introduction

Hey there! Ready to test your Deadline Funnel campaign?

In this guide we'll walk through how to test your evergreen Deadline Funnel campaign if you're using the direct integration with your email platform.

You can verify this by going to Edit your campaign &gt; Quick Start Guide and confirm that "API integration" is selected at the top of the page:

## 1. Clear your Deadline Funnel tracking

You always want to start by clearing your tracking.

Go to Edit your campaign &gt; Testing &gt; Clear Tracking:

This will just clear your personal tracking only; it does not affect anyone else in the funnel.

## 2. Add a new subscriber to your email funnel

Add a new email address to your email funnel so that the Deadline Funnel tracking is started for that subscriber when they go through the Deadline Funnel webhook/HTTP Post in your email platform.

Within a few minutes, that new subscriber should show up in the Event Tracking page for your Deadline Funnel campaign:

## 3. Double check your deadline start date and end date

On that same page in Event Tracking, you'll see when the tracking started for that new subscriber and when their deadline is:

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5c520614042863543ccc67d2/file-tu8aC6aL7o.png)

The Event Tracking page will show this information for each person going through your Deadline Funnel campaign. And this is a great place to double check that they're being assigned the correct deadline.

## 4. Testing the email links and timer

Since you added yourself as a new subscriber to your email funnel, you should be receiving an email that contains a [Deadline Funnel link](https://documentation.deadlinefunnel.com/article/16-expiring-links) to your sales page.

Click on that link in your email and verify that it takes you to the correct page and that the timer on the page matches the timer in the email.

## 5. What happens after the deadline expires?

Last but not least, go to Edit your campaign &gt; Testing, and change the start date of your Deadline Funnel tracking so that your tracking is set to an expiration date that's in the past.

Here's how to do that:

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5c5234ea042863543ccc69e6/file-UTEnwrJmch.gif)

Now, refresh your email and you'll see the expired image in your email, and when you click the Deadline Funnel link in the email you will be redirected to your expired page. That's what will happen as people are going through the funnel and their personal deadline expires!

## What's next?

If everything is working as expected, you're ready to go live!

We recommend clearing your tracking again at this point \(so you can access your pages again!\), which you can do under Edit your campaign &gt; Testing &gt; Clear tracking.

It's also helpful to enable [Preview Mode](https://documentation.deadlinefunnel.com/article/544-preview-mode), which will allow you to add your IP to a whitelist so you don't get redirected away from your own page in the future.
