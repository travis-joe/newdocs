# ActiveCampaign

## Getting Started

Deadline Funnel can help boost your sales for your marketing campaigns in ActiveCampaign! ðŸ˜Ž

Each subscriber in your sequence will be automatically assigned their own custom deadline - whether you're doing a webinar... an email sequence... an automated launch... or really ANY type of campaign.

If you're not using a deadline you're leaving money on the table!

Here's a quick guide on how to get started with Deadline Funnel + ActiveCampaign, so you can build your evergreen funnel.

**Deadline Funnel University:** Check out the [How to Create an Evergreen Email Funnel course](https://university.deadlinefunnel.com/courses/evergreen) on Deadline Funnel University for a free training series on building your first evergreen campaign!

## 1. Create your Deadline Funnel campaign

First things first - you will need to [create a campaign in Deadline Funnel](https://deadlinefunnel.com/promotions/create) before you can set up the integration with ActiveCampaign.

When creating your campaign, we recommend selecting the blueprints option and then choose the "Email Sequence + Special Offer" blueprint:

Then you'll set the deadline length and add your first funnel step\(s\). Don't worry too much about those two items - you can come back later and change those at any time.

Once you've created your Deadline Funnel campaign, you will be taken to the Quick Start Guide, where you can verify that the correct trigger has been selected:

After you've created your Deadline Funnel campaign, [set up the integration between Deadline Funnel and ActiveCampaign](https://documentation.deadlinefunnel.com/article/244-how-to-integrate-deadline-funnel-with-activecampaign-api).

This integration determines where you start each subscriber's Deadline Funnel tracking as they are going through your automation.

## 3. Add Deadline Funnel email links to your automation

Once the integration is up and running, any subscriber who goes through your automation will start their Deadline Funnel tracking as soon as they reach the "webhook" in your automation.

That's the first key part for Deadline Funnel tracking - tracking the email address of each subscriber as they go through your automation.

The second critical part for Deadline Funnel tracking is to add Deadline Funnel email links to the emails in your automation, wherever you're linking to a page that has a Deadline Funnel timer or redirect on it.

That would normally be your special offer page, which normally would get redirected to a different page after the deadline expires.

[Here's our guide on adding the Deadline Funnel email links to your emails.](https://documentation.deadlinefunnel.com/article/16-expiring-links)

Please note that you cannot integrate Deadline Funnel + ActiveCampaign correctly unless you add the DF links to your emails!

## Email timers and dynamic deadline text \(optional\)

You can customize your ActiveCampaign emails with an animated timer, or add a dynamic date and time. Step-by-step instructions for adding those can be found in the following articles:

* [Add an animated countdown timer to your emails](https://documentation.deadlinefunnel.com/article/246-how-to-add-email-countdown-code-to-activecampaign)
* [Add a dynamic date and time to your emails](https://documentation.deadlinefunnel.com/article/377-how-to-add-a-dynamic-date-and-time-to-activecampaign-email)

## How to Time Your ActiveCampaign Emails to Match Your Deadline \(optional\)

You can time your reminder emails to be in sync with your leads' individual deadlines. We have a guide on [how to do that here](https://documentation.deadlinefunnel.com/article/689-how-to-time-your-activecampaign-emails-to-match-your-deadline)!

## Automated webinars
