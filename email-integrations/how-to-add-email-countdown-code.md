# How to Add Email Countdown Code

In the Email Setup tab you can grab code to create an **animated countdown timer** and also use Deadline Funnel email links for your emails in your Deadline Funnel campaign.

Your specific email software \(AWeber, InfusionSoft, ActiveCampaign, etc\) will determine whether you will add the animated countdown image using option A or option B.

**Option A** \(see red A below\) is for email editors that allow you to add an HTML block or if you are editing the HTML code directly. Copy and paste the HTML Image Code into your editor where you want the image to appear.

**Option B** \(see red B below\) is for email editors where you can add an image by indicating an Image URL. Copy and paste the Image URL where indicated in your email editor.
