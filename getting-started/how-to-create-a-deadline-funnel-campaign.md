## Step 1. Give us a bit of information about your campaign.

First things first - you'll need to give your campaign a name and select or create a category for it to fit under \(the category is for your organization within the admin\). Next you'll select your email platform and landing page builder. You have the option to choose up to two landing page builders. Once you've done that, you can hit Next.

## Step 2. Choose A Blueprint:

You can choose from several blueprints to create a new campaign.

**Email sequence + special offer:** Set up an automated email sequence that presents each of your subscribers with a unique deadline.

**Automated webinar:** Build an automated webinar funnel with a special offer and deadline for each webinar attendee.

**15-minute optin upsell:** Create a short upsell offer that's presented after someone opts into your email list.

**Messenger bot promotion:** Integrate with ManyChat or ChatFuel to create evergreen Messenger sequences.

**Day of the week:** This is an evergreen deadline that will always end on a specific day of the week.

**Special offer for first 100 buyers:** Send a special offer to your list that's only available for the first _\__ people who purchase.

**Holiday or fixed-date promotion:** Create a fixed-date campaign that ends at the same time for everyone.

**Page Visit:** Start someoneâ€™s tracking when they visit a page. This can be used for campaigns where you are not integrating with an email sequence.

## Step 3. Select your deadline.

## Step 4. Add your Funnel Steps.

Your Funnel Steps are the pages that you want connected to your deadline. This includes your special offer page, and a page for after the deadline expires \(ie. â€˜Sorry you missed itâ€™, a regular price page, etc.\)
