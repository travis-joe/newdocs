**Note:** You need to create a Deadline Funnel campaign before integrating
with Kajabi.

 **Important:** Kajabi has a unique behavior that creates 2 separate URLs for
the same checkout page. To cover both cases, you should add **both**  checkout
urls as their own Funnel Step as shown in the guide below.

## Add a Floating Bar Countdown to a checkout page:

To start, navigate to the 'Tracking Code' section of your Deadline Funnel
dashboard and copy your Tracking Code:

Navigate to the Settings tab in the left hand menu of your Kajabi dashboard
and click on 'Checkout Settings':

Tracking Code' box under Checkout Settings and save your changes:

**Important note:** You will only need to add the Deadline Funnel tracking
code in this box one time. Once it's added, it will be applied to all of your
checkout pages in Kajabi. However, this won't mean the deadline is active on
all pages. Only pages that are added to the Funnel Steps of your Deadline
Funnel campaign will be connected to that deadline.

Now open up your checkout page in a new tab and copy the URL in the address
bar.

Return to Deadline Funnel > Edit your campaign > Funnel Steps and click 'Add
New Page'. Paste the URL of your page into the first box, add a redirect URL
for after the deadline expires, and hit 'Save':

countdown timer. Here's an example of what the Floating Bar will look like:

## Add an Inline Countdown Timer to a Checkout Page:

After following all the steps below, click 'Edit Settings' on your Funnel Step
and select 'Display an Inline Timer' instead. You'll see a code snippet in
this box, you'll need to copy this so you can add it to your checkout page:
