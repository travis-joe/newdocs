4\. When you send yourself the broadcast email, you will see that the placeholder has been replaced with the deadline text format you chose in your setup. 
     **NOTE** : **You must send the actual broadcast after the deadline has been triggered so there is an actual deadline to display. The placeholder will not be replaced in a test message**. **You can send the broadcast to yourself first to test the delivery.**
