### Create your Deadline Funnel campaign

Before you can add the Deadline Funnel timer to your Webflow page, you will
need to create your first Deadline Funnel campaign.

### Adding the countdown to a Webflow page

1\. In the Deadline Funnel admin, click on the Tracking Code tab at the top of the far left hand menu. A lightbox will appear with the Tracking Code for your account, go ahead and click 'Copy the tracking code' to copy it to your clipboard:

2\. Go into your Webflow account, navigate to Project Settings > Custom Code, and paste the Deadline Funnel Tracking Code into the Header box:

3\. Now navigate back to Deadline Funnel and go into Edit Your Campaign > Funnel Steps. Click 'Add New Page' at the top and paste the URL of your Webflow page into the 'Before the Deadline' box. You can also add a redirect URL here, if you want to send people away from the replay after the deadline has expired:

And you're done! The Floating Bar timer will now appear on your page. Here's
an example of what the Floating Bar looks like:
