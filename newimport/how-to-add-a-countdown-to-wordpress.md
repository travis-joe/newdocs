**Note** :  While your Deadline Funnel Tracking code will be automatically
added to every page on your WordPress site, the countdown timer will not
appear until you add your page(s) to the Funnel Steps and tell Deadline Funnel
what kind of countdown to show.

### Disable the plugin for admin users:

You can disable the plugin for anyone who's logged into your Wordpress account
as an admin. This is handy in cases where you need to be able to make changes
to your page(s) without being tracked by Deadline Funnel. To use this feature
simply go into the Deadline Funnel tab in the admin and toggle it on:

Just be sure to turn this feature back off if you're running a test of your
funnel. :)

## Add a Floating Bar countdown timer to your page:

Navigate to 'Funnel Steps' in your Deadline Funnel admin. Click 'Add new page'
and 1) add the URL of your WordPress page, 2) select 'Display a floating bar',
3) add the URL where you want the page to redirect when the deadline expires,
then 4) click 'Save':
