In the Deadline Funnel admin, navigate to Edit Your Campaign > Email Setup and
click on the Email Timer Code to copy it to your clipboard:

Now in your email editor in Mautic, grab a 'Code Mode' box and drag it to the
spot in your email where you want the timer to be displayed:

Now if you scroll down in the right hand menu you should see a section where
you can add code to that box:

Simply aste the email timer code from Deadline Funnel there, and the animated
timer will appear in your email:

Be sure to save the changes to your email when you're done, and you're all
set! :)
