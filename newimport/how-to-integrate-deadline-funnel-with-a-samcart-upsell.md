## Add the Upsell Page URL as a Funnel Step in Deadline Funnel

1

    In SamCart, add your upsell to a product, place the product in sandbox mode, and 'purchase' the product. This will take you to the upsell:

There are two different IDs in the URL, the first one
(lkhPMHvFZkcZaCuxREQUBXdh) represents the specific upsell funnel.  

3

    Return to Deadline Funnel and add the Upsell URL (intentionally leaving off the ?cart=... part at the end) to your funnel steps:

4

    With your product still in sandbox mode in SamCart, 'purchase' the product again to see the countdown timer on your upsell page.

That's it! You've now integrated your Deadline Funnel countdown into your
SamCart upsell page.
