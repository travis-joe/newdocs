## **Introduction**

In this video, we provide an overview of how to integrate your webinar
platform with Deadline Funnel.

## Emails

There are two types of emails you'll be sending:

  * Pre-webinar (registration links, reminders)
  * Post-webinar (replay, sales emails)

You can use EasyWebinar to send all of the pre-webinar notifications, but it's
important to use your actual email platform (e.g. ActiveCampaign) for sending
out all emails after the webinar happens.

This means that your replay email as well as your post-webinar sales emails
need to be sent from your email platform (e.g. ActiveCampaign), and not sent
through EasyWebinar.

## Two integration options

There are two main ways to integrate EasyWebinar and Deadline Funnel.

If you are using one of these email platforms, follow the direct integration
method:

  * ActiveCampaign
  * AWeber
  * ConvertKit
  * Drip
  * Infusionsoft
  * Ontraport

If you are using a different email platform, follow the optin integration
method.

## Direct integration method

The first step of the direct integration method is to integrate EasyWebinar
with your email platform.

The most important part of this step is that you send these two tags from
EasyWebinar to your email platform, as shown in the following screenshot:

  * A tag that is applied when someone "came to the webinar" - e.g. **samplewebinar-attended-webinar**
  * A tag that is applied when someone "did not come" - e.g. **samplewebinar-missed-webinar**

The next step of the direct integration method is to integrate Deadline Funnel
with your email platform, so that whenever either of those two tags are
applied in your email platform, Deadline Funnel starts the tracking for that
subscriber.
