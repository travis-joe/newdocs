The direct integration with Platformly is the easiest and most flexible way to
integrate Deadline Funnel with your Platformly account. Each Deadline Funnel
campaign gets its own integration.

Important: You will need to complete the setup of your first evergreen
campaign before you will see the API integrations link in the left nav. Be
sure to select API Trigger as the trigger and Platformly as your email service
provider.

1\. In your Platformly account, select Integrations and then Deadline Funnel:

2\. Click Connect:

3\. In your visual automation in Platformly, add a new element where you want the Deadline Funnel tracking to begin for your Deadline Funnel campaign:

4\. Select Deadline Funnel:

5\. Select your Deadline Funnel campaign and then press Save:

Now the deadline will begin for each person as soon as they reach that point
in your automation.

You can test by adding a contact to your automation, waiting for the contact
to reach the Deadline Funnel action in the automation, and then check under
Event Tracking in Deadline Funnel to confirm their email address was received
by Deadline Funnel.

## Important Note about Email Links

For the integration to work, you need to use the Deadline Funnel [email
links](http://documentation.deadlinefunnel.com/article/16-expiring-links) in
any of your emails that link to a sales page with a countdown timer, or that
link to a page in your funnel that links to another page with your countdown
timer.

In other words, the integration requires that your subscribers click one of
the Deadline Funnel email links before they reach a page with a countdown.
This is necessary in order to make sure each subscriber is assigned the
correct deadline.
