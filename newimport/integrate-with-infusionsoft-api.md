You will need to be logged into your Infusionsoft Account before clicking
"Integrate with Infusionsoft"

On the next screen click the blue 'Allow' button to connect your InfusionSoft
account with your Deadline Funnel account, and you should see a Success!
message at the top of the screen once it's connected:
