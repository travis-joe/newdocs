[UseProof.com](https://useproof.com/) is an app that allows you to display
social proof on your website - typically resulting in higher conversion rates!

It shows your website visitors people who have recently completed a specific
action - such as signing up for a free trial, opting into your email list, or
in this case completing a survey.

bottom-left corner) people who have recently completed the survey:
