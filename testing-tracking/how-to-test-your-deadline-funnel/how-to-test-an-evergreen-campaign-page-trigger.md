# How to Test an Evergreen/Hybrid Campaign \(page trigger\)

## Introduction

Hey there! Ready to test your Deadline Funnel campaign?

In this guide we'll walk through how to test your evergreen Deadline Funnel campaign if you're using a page visit to trigger the deadline.

You can verify this by going to Edit your campaign &gt; Quick Start Guide and confirm that "a page visit" is selected at the top of the page:

## 1. Clear your Deadline Funnel tracking

You always want to start by clearing your tracking.

Go to Edit your campaign &gt; Testing &gt; Clear Tracking:

This will just clear your personal tracking only; it does not affect anyone else in the funnel.

## 2. Visit your page

Go to the page you have integrated with Deadline Funnel and verify that you see the timer there.

You should immediately see new tracking details show up under Edit your campaign &gt; Testing:

## 3. Double check your deadline start date and end date

On that same page, you'll see when your tracking started and when your deadline is:

The Event Tracking page will show this information for each person going through your Deadline Funnel campaign. It's a great place to double check that everyone is being assigned the correct deadline.

## 4. What happens after the deadline expires?

Last but not least, go to Edit your campaign &gt; Testing, and change the start date of your Deadline Funnel tracking so that your tracking is set to an expiration date that's in the past.

Here's how to do that:

Now try to visit your page again and you will be redirected to your expired page. That's what will happen as people are going through the funnel and their personal deadline expires!

## What's next?

If everything is working as expected, you're ready to go live!

We recommend clearing your tracking again at this point \(so you can access your pages again!\), which you can do under Edit your campaign &gt; Testing &gt; Clear tracking.

It's also helpful to enable [Preview Mode](https://documentation.deadlinefunnel.com/article/544-preview-mode), which will allow you to add your IP to a whitelist so you don't get redirected away from your own page in the future.
