This trigger is ideal for quick deadlines (like a 15-minute upsell) that do
not include sending email reminders about the deadline. For example, after
someone opts in, you could present a 15-minute special offer and use a page
trigger for the 15-minute countdown.

### Integrating Deadline Funnel with your Optin Page/Form:

1

     Create your Evergreen Campaign and select 'Page Visit' for how leads will enter your funnel:

3

     Paste this code onto your page. If you have a section for adding custom tracking codes, that would be ideal, but the header of the page will also work. 

3

     View the page where your tracking code is located and copy the URL in the address bar.

     Return to Deadline Funnel account and navigate to Edit your campaign > Funnel Steps:

### Testing the Page Trigger

To test, clear your tracking by visiting Testing and clicking 'Clear
Tracking'. Now visit your page and then check under Event Tracking in Deadline
Funnel that your visit was tracked.

And you're all set! The quick deadline will now begin based on when a lead
lands on this URL.
