Deadline Funnel protects your deadlines and pages based on the settings in
your Funnel Steps:

You cannot give Deadline Funnel 2 different sets of instructions for the same
URL by using the same URL as the 'Before' URL in 2 different Deadline Funnel
campaigns.

Re-using this URL for a 'Before' step will cause errors with page redirects
and timer visibility.

If you try to add a URL to your Funnel Steps  as the 'Before' step, which has
already been used in a different campaign, you will see an error message:
"Please enter a valid before URL":

The solution is to use a different 'Before' URL in your funnel steps.

If you like the original page, you can use it in a different Deadline Funnel
campaign by cloning/duplicating the page and adding the new cloned page URL to
your funnel steps as the 'Before' step in the new campaign.

**Note:**   You can use the same URL as the 'Before' URL in your funnel steps
in **the same**  campaign, i.e., you want a floating bar AND an inline timer
on the same page.
