**Note:**  You need to create a Deadline Funnel campaign before integrating
with Kajabi.

##

## Add a Floating Bar Countdown to a Kajabi Sales Page:

To start, navigate to the 'Tracking Code' section of your Deadline Funnel
dashboard and copy your Tracking Code:

Navigate to the Settings tab in the left hand menu of your Kajabi dashboard
and click on 'Site Details':

the 'Header Page Scripts' box:

Then hit 'Save' at the top.

**Important note:** You will only need to add the Deadline Funnel tracking
code in this box one time. Once it's added, it will be applied to all of your
sales and landing pages in Kajabi. However, this won't mean the deadline is
active on all pages. Only pages that are added to the Funnel Steps of your
Deadline Funnel campaign will be connected to that deadline.

Now open up your Kajabi landing page in a new tab and copy the URL in the
address bar:

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/593afa7604286305c68cf93a/file-JxqyqPPQ7I.png)Return to Deadline Funnel > Edit your campaign > Funnel Steps
and click 'Add New Page'. Paste the URL of your page into the first box, add a
redirect URL for after the deadline expires, and hit 'Save':

Now you can refresh your Kajabi page, and you should see the Floating Bar.
Here's an example of what it will look like:

## Using an Inline Countdown on your Kajabi Landing Page:

If you are using the Inline Countdown type, you must complete these additional
steps:

After you add your landing page URL to the funnel steps and select 'Display an
inline timer', copy the HTML snippet needed to add your countdown timer to
your page:

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5c783cd22c7d3a0cb9321570/file-hMgAYWDhqC.png)In the editor for your Sales Page, click the source code icon
for the Body section:

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5b05d6102c7d3a2f9011d7a3/file-UHctTBlOFC.png)Paste your Deadline Funnel HTML snippet into the source code
wherever you would like your countdown timer to appear and click 'Ok' and then
save your page:

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5b05d9dc0428635ba8b2a928/file-uAwiPuEPnY.png)

That's it! Your inline countdown will now appear on your Sales page.
