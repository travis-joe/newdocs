You can now view your Wix page to see your Floating Bar countdown timer.

## How to add an Inline Countdown Timer to your Wix page:

Our inline timers require an HTML block within a page in order to function.
Unfortunately the "HTML Embed" blocks that Wix offers are shown in your pages
as  
"iFrame" elements, which are not compatible with our inline timers at this
time. We have attempted to find solutions around this issue, however we are
limited to the elements that Wix provides in their visual editor.
