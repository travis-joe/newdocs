Below are instructions for integrating a Deadline Funnel Evergreen countdown
with a Podia (formerly known as Coach) Sales Page or Course Page.

You need to create your Deadline Funnel campaign before integrating with
Podia.

**Note** : Podia doesn't load tracking codes when you are logged into Podia.
If you're logged into Podia and open your Podia landing or product page in
another browser, your Deadline Funnel timer will not appear. Once you log out
of Podia, your Deadline Funnel countdowns will appear.
