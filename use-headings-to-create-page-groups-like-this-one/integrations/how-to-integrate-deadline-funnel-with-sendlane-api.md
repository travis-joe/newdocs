The direct integration with Sendlane is the easiest way to integrate Deadline
Funnel with your Sendlane account.

**Important** : You will need to [create an evergreen
campaign](https://documentation.deadlinefunnel.com/article/629-how-to-create-a-deadline-funnel-campaign) before you will see the API integrations link in
the left menu. Each Deadline Funnel campaign requires a separate integration -so follow the steps below for each campaign you want to integrate with
Sendlane!

1\.  Click on API integrations in the left menu, then select 'add a new integration':

2\. Select Sendlane:

3\. Now you can copy the Deadline Funnel webhook for setting up the integration in Sendlane:

5\. Add your Deadline Funnel webhook to a current Sendlane automation or create a new automation. In this instance, we are using 'Subscribes to a list':

6\. Click the '+' button to add an action:

7\. Select 'Webhook' in 'What action would you like to add': 

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5da46f8204286364bc905a86/file-mogCEu384z.jpg)


8\. Paste your Deadline Funnel Webhook into the 'URL' box and select 'POST' as the method:

Now the deadline will begin for each contact as soon as they reach the webhook
in your automation:

You can test by adding a contact to your automation, waiting for the webhook
to happen, and then checking under Event Tracking in Deadline Funnel to
confirm their email address was received by Deadline Funnel:

## Important Note about Email Links

For the integration to work, you need to use the Deadline Funnel [email
links](http://documentation.deadlinefunnel.com/article/16-expiring-links) in
any of your emails that link to a sales page with a countdown timer, or that
link to a page in your funnel that links to another page with your countdown
timer.

In other words, the integration requires that your subscribers click one of
the Deadline Funnel email links before they reach a page with a countdown.
This is necessary in order to make sure each subscriber is assigned the
correct deadline.
