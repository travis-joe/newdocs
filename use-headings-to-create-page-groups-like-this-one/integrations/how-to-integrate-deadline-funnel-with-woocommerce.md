## How to Hide Your Lower-Priced Product from your WooCommerce Shop

Deadline Funnel's tracking will re-direct site visitors away from your sales
page when their deadline expires, but you may also want to hide the sales page
from your WooCommerce shop. To hide the lower-priced product from the shop:

1\.  Navigate to the lower-priced in your website and edit the 'Catalog visibility':

2\. Select 'Hidden' to keep this product from appearing in your shop.
