## Using Deadline Funnel with Facebook Chatbots:

You can add authentic deadlines to your Facebook chatbot automated sequences
so that after someone subscribes you can let them know they have a specific
number of days or hours to take advantage of your special offer.

At this time, we don't offer email timers for chatbots, but we are looking
into whether this is possible.

## Using Deadline Funnel with Facebook Ads:

To take advantage of authentic deadlines with your Facebook ads, you simply
add your Deadline Funnel Tracking Code to the landing page for your Facebook
Ad.

**You will use the regular URL for your landing page in your Facebook ad** and
be sure to add this URL to your Funnel Steps in Deadline Funnel. Deadline
Funnel will track your visitors based on both cookies and their IP address.

###  **Important note if you're using the Pre-Launch feature:**

If you have Pre-Launch enabled, then you will need to set up a custom URL
(i.e. go.mywebsite.com) and then use the special Deadline Funnel Email Link
for the special offer in your Facebook Ad, minus the "em=" parameter at the
end.

[Check out our tutorial on how to set up Custom URLs
here.](https://documentation.deadlinefunnel.com/article/10-custom-urls)  

The final link you'll use will look something like this:

<http://go.mywebsite.com/go/123/abc>

This will ensure that anyone who clicks on that link from the ad will be able
to access the page, even though Pre-Launch is enabled.
