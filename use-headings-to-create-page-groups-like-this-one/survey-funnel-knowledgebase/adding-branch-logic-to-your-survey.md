Branch Logic gives you the ability to choose “If someone answers ‘Yes’ to
Question A, show them Question B next”, but if they answer “No” to Question A,
show them Question C next.”  

## Setting up the questions

To get started with Branch Logic, switch to the Questions tab and make sure
that you have at least three questions added to your survey, and that **at
least one of those questions is a multiple-choice question**.

For a fictional health and fitness business example we’ll set up the following
five questions:

**1\. (Multiple choice) What is your single biggest challenge with health and
fitness?**

**2\. (Long or short text) What is your biggest challenge with losing
weight?**

eating?**

right exercise plan?**

## Adding Branch Logic

We’re going to use Branch Logic, based on the answer to the first question
(finding out what their biggest challenge is), we’ll show them a follow-up
question that lets the person taking the survey provide additional details.

     Click on the “Add scoring and branch logic” button for the first question:

That’s it! Now you’ve created Branch Logic so each person sees the questions
you want them to based on their previous answers.
