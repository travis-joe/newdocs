Short answers are available for multiple-choice (radio) questions in your
survey.

In this example, the question is "What is your favorite color?" and one of the
answer choices is "I like blue because it reminds me of the sky."

With this new update, we have added "blue" as the short answer value for
Zapier, so that "blue" is the string that can be passed to your email
provider/CRM through Zapier, instead of "I like blue because it reminds me of
the sky."

This makes it a lot easier to add specific tags based on answer values, in
your email provider/CRM.
