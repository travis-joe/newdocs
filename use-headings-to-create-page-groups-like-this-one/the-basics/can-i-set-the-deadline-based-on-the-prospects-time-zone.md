Currently the answer is, no, but we _are_ investigating this feature.

### There are two reasons why this feature isn't currently offered:

  1. To replicate a live promotion
  2. To synchronize your automated emails and your deadline

#### To replicate a live promotion:

Similar to a live promotion like a Black Friday or Cyber Monday event, you
would announce to your leads that the special deal is over at a specific time,
day, and time zone.

#### To synchronize your automated emails and your deadline:

The timing could become an issue if your email software is set for a specific
time zone and the deadline was set to each lead's individual time zone.

We recommend choosing a time zone for your email software that is best for the
market you're selling to (for example, for the US market you might want to
choose the US Pacific time zone) and matching that time zone in Deadline
Funnel.

Contact our team if you need any clarification about this. Thx!
