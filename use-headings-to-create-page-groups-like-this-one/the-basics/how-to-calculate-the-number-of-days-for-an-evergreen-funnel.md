# How to Calculate the Number of Days for an Evergreen Funnel

If you're setting up an evergreen funnel and you're not sure exactly how many days you should choose, here's how to figure it out, and also how to make sure you have the timing correct.

## Example: 3 Days at 11:59pm

If someone starts their tracking on Monday at 11am EST, their deadline will be Thursday at 11:59pm EST. The day their tracking starts is counted as Day 0, and Thursday at midnight is the deadline.

## Example: 48-hour Deadline

If someone starts their tracking on Monday at 11am EST, their deadline will be Wednesday at 11am EST - exactly 48 hours later.

## Test Your Campaign Before Sending

Deadline Funnel makes it easy to test.

Our best advice is to map out the timing of your emails in a spreadsheet and indicate exactly what day their deadline would expire if a lead were to enter your funnel today. Since you're going to test by entering your funnel today, if you know the exact date that you would be getting the final email, then you would compare this to your tracking in Deadline Funnel.

Here's an example from a client who mapped out his emails like this:

As you can see, he knows that if he begins in the funnel today, his final email will arrive on a specific Wednesday.

And in fact this matches exactly what he saw when he went through as a new lead \(after deleting his tracking\). See Deadline Date row below:
