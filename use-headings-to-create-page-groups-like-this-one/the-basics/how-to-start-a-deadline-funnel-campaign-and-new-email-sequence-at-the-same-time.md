This method is what we sometimes call the "Rack the Shotgun" sequence.

What that term means is that you have a sequence that is designed to get your
leads to click on a link that is related to the promotion topic you're going
to be promoting.

Let's look at an example using Ontraport - but this works with almost every
email software provider:

Imagine you're promoting a course on publishing a book on Kindle, you could
send three emails over 3 days alerting them to a great interview you came
across. The goal of the 3 emails is to get your subscribers that are
interested in the topic to click through from the link in the emails.

**As soon as they click to get the content, 3 things happen** :

  * the click signals Ontraport to move them into a **second** promotion sequence that sells your course on Kindle publishing and...
  * the click cookies them to Deadline Funnel and triggers their campaign
  * the first step in the new campaign is to send an http post to Deadline Funnel

That last bit is to add the "deadline text" date to the Ontraport record so
you can use it in their email.

**"What if my email software doesn't have an http post or webhook?"**

You can still use this "rack the shotgun" method to sync up the timing of your
sequences so that when your subscribers click a trigger link in one of the
first 3 emails:

  * the click signals your email service provider to move them into a second promotion sequence that sells your course on Kindle publishing and...
  * the click cookies them to Deadline Funnel and starts their campaign
