# How to Test an Evergreen/Hybrid Campaign \(link click trigger\)

Hey there! Ready to test your Deadline Funnel campaign?

In this guide we'll walk through how to test your evergreen Deadline Funnel campaign if you're using an email link click to trigger the deadline.

You can verify this by going to Edit your campaign &gt; Quick Start Guide and confirm that "link click" is selected at the top of the page:

## 1. Clear your Deadline Funnel tracking

You always want to start by clearing your tracking.

Go to Edit your campaign &gt; Testing &gt; Clear Tracking:

This will just clear your personal tracking only; it does not affect anyone else in the funnel.

## 2. Click on the link trigger

Go ahead and opt-in to your own funnel with a test email, then wait to receive the email that contains a Deadline Funnel link to your sales page. Click on that link in your email and verify that it takes you to the correct page.

Within a few minutes, your test email should show up in the Event Tracking page for your Deadline Funnel campaign:

This means the link has successfully triggered your deadline.

## 3. Double check your deadline start date and end date

On that same page in Event Tracking, you'll see when your tracking started and when your deadline is:

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5c5233d52c7d3a66e32dd5fd/file-%20pSroNdipK2.png)

The Event Tracking page will show this information for each person going through your Deadline Funnel campaign. So this is a great place to double check that they're being assigned the correct deadline.

## 4. What happens after the deadline expires?

Last but not least, go to Edit your campaign &gt; Testing, and change the start date of your Deadline Funnel tracking so that your tracking is set to an expiration date that's in the past.

Here's how to do that:

Now, refresh your email and you'll see the expired image in your email, and when you click the Deadline Funnel link in the email you will be redirected to your expired page. That's what will happen as people are going through the funnel and their personal deadline expires!

## What's next?

If everything is working as expected, you're ready to go live!

We recommend clearing your tracking again at this point \(so you can access your pages again!\), which you can do under Edit your campaign &gt; Testing &gt; Clear tracking.

It's also helpful to enable [Preview Mode](https://documentation.deadlinefunnel.com/article/544-preview-mode), which will allow you to add your IP to a whitelist so you don't get redirected away from your own page in the future.
