# How to use UTM parameters with Deadline Funnel

To use UTM parameters with Deadline Funnel, you can add the UTM parameters to the end of your Deadline Funnel email link.

Please note: **don't add the UTM parameters to your funnel steps inside of Deadline Funnel!** 

You'll append the parameters to the links after you paste the Deadline Funnel links into your emails.

Here's an example of what your email link will look like with the UTM parameters:

[http://dfl0.us/go/123/abc/12345](http://dfl0.us/go/123/abc/12345)?em=%EMAIL%& utm\_source=SOURCE&utm\_medium=MEDIUM&utm\_campaign=CAMPAIGN
