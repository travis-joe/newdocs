# Can Deadline Funnel Track Visitors Across Multiple Devices

Deadline Funnel is extremely good at tracking and uses a combination of methods that gives you the highest reliability that leads will be tracked from one device to another even when they change locations AND devices.

For example, if a lead opts in on device one, uses device two to read the email and then clicks your Deadline Funnel email link, they will see the correct countdown in all 3 situations.

Deadline Funnel's primary method of tracking is using cookies but when no cookie is found then the lead's IP address is checked. If the IP address isn't found but information in the unique link \(clicked from an email\) locates them in the database, then Deadline Funnel will re-cookie them with the correct information.
