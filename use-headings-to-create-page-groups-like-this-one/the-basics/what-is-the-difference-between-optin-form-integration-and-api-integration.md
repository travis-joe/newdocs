In general, the API integration is usually the best option for integrating
Deadline Funnel with your email provider because it provides the most
flexibility.

The API integration offers:

  * Streamlined setup for working with custom fields
  * The ability to trigger your Deadline Funnel at virtually any point in your email sequence or automation, not only when someone first opts in

If you are using an email provider we don't have an API integration with, then
our  [optin form integration is a great
option](http://documentation.deadlinefunnel.com/article/17-optin-form)
instead!
