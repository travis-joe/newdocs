1. You can choose the specific last follow up number subscribers are set to once they complete the existing series. To begin the follow up series again, select "0". Then, click the "Finish" button. Alternatively, if you're moving a subscriber to another list, you can select "Continue from original followup if found on target list" to start them at the last place they left off on the list they're being moved to.

7. If you want to delay moving them by a specific number of days, enter that number into the "Move after N days:" field.

To specify which day of the week to move the subscriber on, click "Advanced Options" and select the day of the week they should be moved on. You can also select whether to move subscribers who have reached the end of the list or all subscribers on that day.
