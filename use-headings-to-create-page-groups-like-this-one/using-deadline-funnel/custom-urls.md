```text
 In order for the custom URL to work (e.g., <http://demo.allegraloves.com>), you will need to set up the CNAME for your sub-domain in your DNS manager, with the CNAME pointing to deadlinefunnel.com. Watch the video for step-by-step instructions for creating and pointing the CNAME. 
```

```text
 Once this is set up you will be able to select your new custom URL from the drop-down under My Account >> Update custom URL: 
```

**NOTE** : To test this, clear your tracking and visit your email link, to check that you land on the 'before' URL you specified in your Deadline Funnel campaign.
