Most of the time, you don't need to use a wildcard :)

For example, if you're sending visitors to:  <http://yoursite.com/somepage/>,
then you would just include <http://yoursite.com/somepage> in the Funnel Steps
of your Deadline Funnel campaign.

But if you want to display a timer on an entire category of your website, for
example, then you could add this as your funnel step URL in Deadline Funnel:

<http://yoursite.com/page/*>

And the wildcard (asterisk) at the end of that funnel step URL tells Deadline
Funnel to display the timer on any matching pages:

<http://yoursite.com/page/one/>

<http://yoursite.com/page/two/>

...

It is interpreted as, "all URLs that start with <http://yoursite.com/page/>
should be treated the same in this funnel step".
