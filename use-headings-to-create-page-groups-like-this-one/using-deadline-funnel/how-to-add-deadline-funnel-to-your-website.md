To add Deadline Funnel to your site, you will need to first click on the
tracking code icon in your Deadline Funnel account and copy/paste the tracking
code into your website's header area (see first screenshot below).

Many times if you are using a page builder, there will be a "scripts" section
inside of the page builder's basic or advanced configuration that will allow
you to paste this tracking code inside of your site's header without needing
to edit any HTML code at all.

If you do not see this as an option, we recommend asking the page builder's
support team if they offer that feature. You may also email us at
[help@deadlinefunnel.com](mailto:mailto:help@deadlinefunnel.com) if you are
having any trouble installing the tracking code.

Once you have the tracking code in place, your next step is to add your site's
page link to the Deadline Funnel >> Funnel Steps area. Then press save.

Once those two steps are done, you are ready to [test your
page](https://documentation.deadlinefunnel.com/article/660-how-to-test-your-deadline-funnel) to ensure that the timer shows up.
