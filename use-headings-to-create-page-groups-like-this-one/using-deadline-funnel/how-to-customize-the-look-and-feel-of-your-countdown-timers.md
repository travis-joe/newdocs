### Adding the webpage timer to your page:

In order to add the webpage timer to your special offer page, you need to
first add the URL of your page as a Funnel Step and then select 'Display an
inline timer'. Once you've done this, you'll see a code snippet pop up:

This code needs to be added to your page wherever you want the webpage timer
to actually appear. Usually it's added in an HTML code box or directly in the
source code of the page.
