There are two options for triggering a deadline manually using MailChimp
contacts. The first method shown is how to instantly trigger a deadline by
directly importing the contacts into Deadline Funnel. The second method allows
you to schedule triggering their deadlines.

## You can use the 'Import Tracking Events' feature to add email(s) and
instantly trigger your campaign for those specific email(s).

1

     Navigate to Deadline Funnel >> Event Tracking. You will keep this window open to paste your leads into.

From here you can select to import your leads. Keep this box handy for the
next few steps.

2

     In a new tab or window, navigate to MailChimp and log in. Go to "Audience" in the top menu and find the list of contacts you wish to manually trigger in Deadline Funnel.

3

     Once you are viewing the audience you want to copy into Deadline Funnel, you will need to export the Audience. Download this file.

When you click to export the list, MailChimp may take a few minutes to
generate the export file for you:

You should get a confirmation that the file has downloaded after clicking the
button below:

     After you download the export file and export the .csv file (comma-separated value/spreadsheet file), you will want to open this with your favorite spreadsheet editing software and copy the email address column contents. In this example, we used Google Sheets.

Alternatively you may use Command/Control + C on your keyboard to copy these
values:

     Navigate back to Deadline Funnel >> Event Tracking. Paste this list using the "Import Tracking Events" button:   

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5d1ce2be04286369ad8d33ae/file-

Verify that the emails are added in the "Tracking Started" section and that
the new tracking dates appear to be correct.

**It is important to note that tracking starts immediately when using this
method.** If you want to follow a schedule for importing leads instead, you
can use the Zapier guide below.

## How to schedule a manual deadline trigger using Zapier

Please note that this method can work with email service providers other than
MailChimp as long as their Zapier triggers support it. For this example,
Mailchimp allows us to trigger subscribers with a tag applied to them.

1

     Create a new Zap using Zapier. The first part will be telling Zapier where to get the leads. We will be adding our leads to an audience list that will be used **one time for this process**. This list, along with the tag we apply, will tell Zapier exactly which people we want to import from MailChimp into Deadline Funnel:   

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5d1ce2ff2c7d3a5cd38e9541/file-8Xaqe2VToP.jpg)

2

     In this example, we have selected the "New Subscriber With Tag" option in Zapier's MailChimp actions, so I will create a tag in MailChimp and apply that to all of my contacts in this temporary Audience list:   

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5d1ce31204286369ad8d33b0/file-H9sLYoeO2W.jpg)

3

     Set the MailChimp Settings in Zapier:   

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5d1ce3592c7d3a5cd38e9547/file-

4

     Set your delay. I chose "delay until" and set the time for the next day at noon. You can choose any time as long as it is within the parameters that Zapier allows:   

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5d1ce33f04286369ad8d33b4/file-p5TJ11S6Eb.jpg)

5  

     The final step in choosing a delay is to run a test to ensure that your target time is accurate. Now set up your Deadline Funnel settings in Zapier by selecting the "Start Deadline" action and selecting the Deadline Funnel campaign you want to add these contacts to. You will then select which field will be sent to that campaign, for this we would simply use the email field as shown below:   

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5d1ce3282c7d3a5cd38e9543/file-5G9f7B5hzn.jpg)

6

     Test your delay. For this example we chose "delay until" and set the time for the next day at noon so that we could quickly test the delay timer (recommended). Make sure to change the delay timer to your actual desired trigger time and activate the Zap. That's it!
