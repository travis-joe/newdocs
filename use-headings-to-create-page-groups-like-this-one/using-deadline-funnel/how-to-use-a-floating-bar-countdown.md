## Introduction

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5d2e310a2c7d3a2ec4bef1a6/file-%20MDbFOY9GIE.png)

The goal for this guide is to give you a quick overview of our Live Editor, which can be found under Edit Your Campaign &gt; Appearance.

We've broken this down into the three main tabs:

* Appearance
* Settings
* Translate

You can also check out our FAQ here.

We're here to help! Contact us on live chat \(bottom right corner of the screen\) Monday - Friday, 8am-4pm PST. Or you can shoot us an email any time at help@deadlinefunnel.com. ðŸ™‚

## Appearance

### 1. Template

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5ce4397c2c7d3a6d82bdc8d0/file-%20Cbbb6sqgfn.png)

You can select the Base of your bar by clicking 'Select A Base', and once you've chosen the base that you like you can hit 'Save Selection':

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5ce4399a0428634b85598605/file-5nIGxbjfcn.png)

You'll see two options for customizing the color of your bar.

We have a selection of color palettes to choose from. Each palette has a combination of colors and various options for how those colors are applied: Bold, Subtle, and Medium:

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5ce439b20428634b85598608/file-8FsY8lmUPs.png)

Or you can do the Custom Color option, which allows you to use HEX codes to match your personal branding:

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5ce439c52c7d3a6d82bdc8d3/file-%20spJgxts7LN.png)

Once you're happy with your color selection, you can hit 'Continue'.

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5ce43a012c7d3a6d82bdc8dc/file-9teTnJ2n34.png)

The final tab in this section is 'Add Custom Avatar'. **Please note:** This feature is only available if you are on the Professional or Consultant plan. If you would like to learn more about how it works, [click here](https://documentation.deadlinefunnel.com/article/671-how-to-use-a-%20custom-avatar-on-your-floating-bar-timer-pro-consultant-plans-only).

And finally, you can choose to enable the Full-Width Bar at the bottom of this screen:

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5ce43a670428634b85598613/file-95CiuZEnud.png)

### 2. Content

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5c6498c32c7d3a66e32e6b42/file-z4qgLPMHAH.png)

In the Content tab you can add custom text to the Floating Bar timer, as well as enable or disable the Call To Action button. The CTA button includes customizable text, as well as a place to input the URL of the page you want it to link to. Once you're satisfied with this, you can hit 'Continue'.

### 3. Placement

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5c6499022c7d3a66e32e6b48/file-%20soWkLlLYrG.png)

The Placement tab is where you can control both the position of the timer, and the size of it.

For example, you can put the timer at the top of the page instead of the bottom, and if you choose the 75% or 50% size options, you also have the ability to move it to the right or left of the screen. This is especially handy if you have another widget on the page that you don't want the timer to cover up.

### 4. Presets

If you've created a bar that you want to be able to apply to other campaigns in your account, you can do that by navigating to the Presets tab and clicking 'Create New Preset'"  
![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5d2e32262c7d3a2ec4bef1b3/file-0smqTlnI3u.png)

Give the preset a name and then hit 'Create':

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5d2e331a042863478674f985/file-0O684KoNn3.png)

And now you'll see it populate as a preset:

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5d2e3377042863478674f988/file-%20Yt4KNcmU3O.png)

You can also create multiple presets:

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5d2e33a1042863478674f98a/file-%20RpZ2dISivb.png)

If you switch to a different campaign, you'll see all of your presets listed here, so you can quickly apply them to different pages. You can also edit the names of existing presets or delete them by clicking the icons to the right of the name.

## Settings

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5dbc4aec2c7d3a7e9ae35c60/file-%20NFPx1waeWE.jpg)

In the Settings tab you can set a delay for when the timer will pop up on the page, as well as disable the Deadline Funnel logo:

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5dbc4c7304286364bc9132fd/file-%20UOU0ErB1NC.jpg)

**Please note:** The option to turn off the Deadline Funnel logo is only available to those with a Professional Plan or higher - But, if the branding is enabled, it links out to Deadline Funnel using your [tell-a- friend](https://deadlinefunnel.com/referrals) link so that you can receive a commission if someone signs up and becomes an active user of Deadline Funnel. :\)

You can also enable or disable the option for people to hide the Floating Bar on your page:

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5dbc4cbc04286364bc913302/file-%20EFQO5vCfA2.jpg)

And enable or disable ' Maximize on Mobile':

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5dbc4dfb04286364bc91332b/file-%20rPXvXTj6mh.jpg)You may also show or hide the "days", "hours", and "seconds" counters in the floating bar:

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5dbc51362c7d3a7e9ae35d10/file-O1TCXDoC59.jpg)

## Translate

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5dfaa7652c7d3a7e9ae54c65/file-2Xif6n00YG.png)

The Translate tab is where you can change the labels on your timer. This includes 'Days', 'Hours', etc., as well as the 'Hide' button.

#### Can I show the full Floating Bar on mobile?

The default on mobile is for this feature to be disabled, which means when people go to your site on their mobile device they'll see a collapsed version of the Floating Bar:

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5dbc4e982c7d3a7e9ae35cb3/file-M1hjbGgSN2.jpg)

Under Settings you can enable 'Maximize on Mobile', which allows you to have the full bar with text automatically displayed when people first land on the page:

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5dbc4dfb04286364bc91332b/file-%20rPXvXTj6mh.jpg)

Once they start to scroll down the page, it will collapse into the smaller Floating Bar.

#### How can I hide the days, hours, or seconds in the Floating Bar?

The default is for the floating bar to the show days, hours, and seconds. You can change that with the following options:

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5dbc51362c7d3a7e9ae35d10/file-O1TCXDoC59.jpg)

#### How do I hide the Deadline Funnel logo?

**Please note:** The option to turn off the Deadline Funnel logo is only available to those with a Professional Plan or higher - But, if the branding is enabled, it links out to Deadline Funnel using your [tell-a- friend](https://deadlinefunnel.com/referrals) link so that you can receive a commission if someone signs up and becomes an active user of Deadline Funnel. :\)

You can disable the Deadline Funnel logo in the Settings tab:

#### How do I see what timer looks like on other pages?

We know that making sure your timer looks good on all of the pages in your funnel is important, so we made sure to include a way for you to see all of your pages inside of the Live Editor. To navigate between them, just click on the URL at the top and a dropdown will appear with all of your Funnel Step URLs:

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5c64ab1f2c7d3a66e32e6c00/file-%20iIek40Ypoe.png)

#### Can I have a custom Floating Bar for each Funnel Step in my campaign?

Yes! If you are on the Pro or Consultant plan, you can have different Floating Bar timers for each of the Funnel Steps in your Deadline Funnel campaign. To assign a specific template/appearance to a specific Funnel Step simply click the 'Save' button and you'll see a dropdown with two options:

![](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5d0d532f2c7d3a6ebd22643a/file-6tqt8mCNC4.png)

1. **Apply to Current Page** - This will apply the current appearance settings you have selected just to the Funnel Step you have selected at the top of the Live Editor.

2. **Apply to All Pages** - This will apply the current appearance settings you have selected to all of the pages in your campaign.
