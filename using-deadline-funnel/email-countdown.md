In the Email Setup tab you can find code to create an  **animated countdown
timer**  and also use email links for your emails in your Deadline Funnel
campaign.

## How to Increase Probability that Your Images Will Be Seen By Your
Subscribers

The following information and steps are **optional.**

Sometimes Gmail, Hotmail, and Yahoo mail and other email providers will turn
off images in an email and ask the subscriber if they want to see the images.

You can make changes to your DNS setup and "whitelist" your domain that sends
the emails so that it's more likely your subscribers will see your countdown
image as soon as the email is opened.

1: Setup DKIM and SPF

DKIM and SPF records can send a clear signal to Gmail, Hotmail, and Yahoo mail
that the domain sending your emails is not sending spam and it's safe to show
images.

The exact method to make these changes is going to be best provided by either

a) your email software company (Drip, ConvertKit, etc) or  
b) your DNS provider for your domain

For example, if you manage your DNS through Google G Suite you can use this
guide.

Another example we found quickly is the article provided by email software
Drip:

Domain>

Contact your email software provider for information on how best to do this.

  
2: Run a check of your domain on: <https://www.mail-tester.com/>

They will show you all the spam listings you could be on for simple, innocent
reasons... and how to fix it.

Example:

The Deadline Funnel client that helped us research this information had this
to say:  
  
_I have my www.[custom domain name here].com domain at google domains and the
email with G Suite , so my thought was everything with google will make my
emails more likable by them... my site is hosted at SquareSpace, with a direct
connection to Google domains...  
  
But I still had to go set up those 3 anti spam/spoof tools manually to get
images to show up right. _
