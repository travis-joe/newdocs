After you have created your countdown, you may want to make some changes.

**Note** : Once you make these changes, **the new deadline will affect
everyone in this funnel**.

You can do this by clicking on 'Edit your campaign' (left nav) and then:

  1. Navigate to the Settings tab
  2. Click on the 'Deadline' tab
  3. You can change your promotion type from Fixed to Evergreen or Hybrid
  4. Change the length of your deadline
  5. Adjust the timezone
  6. Change the language
