Once you've either:

  * Integrated Deadline Funnel with your optin form
  * Integrated Deadline Funnel using the API method

You should have custom fields in your email service provider (or CRM)
including one that holds the "deadlinetext" value for your leads. (You may
have named this field something else during setup.)

Now you can use this custom field as a placeholder in your emails so that you
can add the actual time, day of week, and time zone of the deadline.

The exact workflow depends on which email software (or CRM) you're using, but
the general process is the same.

##  **Here's what you do:**

In most email service providers, you can insert placeholders into the text of
your emails to personalize them. These are values that your email software
will automatically add from the customer record.  

For example, you can insert the customer's name or email. That's standard for
most systems.

Your email software will have other standard placeholders, perhaps their IP
address, or the date they were added (subscribed).

It's the same process for adding the customer's deadline text. Your email
software will show you the custom fields you've created.

Just choose the "deadlinetext" custom field from the list of available custom
fields and then it will be populated with the actual deadline when the email
is sent out.

**Make sure to test before using this in a live marketing campaign.**
