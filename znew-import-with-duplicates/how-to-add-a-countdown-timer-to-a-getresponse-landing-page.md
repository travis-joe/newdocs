# How to add a countdown timer to a GetResponse landing page

## Create your Deadline Funnel campaign

Before you can add the Deadline Funnel timer to your GetResponse landing page, you will need to create your first Deadline Funnel campaign.

[Check out our guide here on how to create a Deadline Funnel campaign](https://documentation.deadlinefunnel.com/article/629-how-to-create-%20a-deadline-funnel-campaign)

Once you've created your Deadline Funnel campaign, you can follow the steps below.

## Adding the floating bar and inline timer to a GetResponse landing page

1. In the Deadline Funnel admin, click on the Tracking Code tab at the top of the far left hand menu. A lightbox will appear with the Tracking Code for your account, go ahead and click 'Copy the tracking code' to copy it to your clipboard:

2. Now go into your GetResponse account and navigate to the Landing Pages section. Locate the landing page you want to integrate with and click 'Edit Page':

3. Drag a 'custom code' element anywhere in the page and insert your Deadline Funnel tracking code from Step 1 into the dialog box. This block won't be visible on the public-facing page, so you can simply put it somewhere out of the way:

4. \[Optional\] If you have an inline timer, you will want to insert a _second_ 'custom code' box into the page and then paste in your inline timer code, which is obtained from the same area as the tracking code in Deadline Funnel:

```text
 Paste it into the 'custom code' box in your page where you would like the inline timer to appear:   
```

You can now publish the GetResponse landing page and add the resulting public page URL to the Deadline Funnel campaign &gt;&gt; Funnel Steps area as appropriate:

6

When this is done you should see your Deadline Funnel timer\(s\) appear on the landing page

And that's it! You're all set. :\)
