**Note:** The timer will not appear in the editing template. You will need to open the actual page to see it.

Next let's discuss how to add an inline timer to your Teachery page...

## How to Add an Inline Timer to your Teachery Page

1. For the Inline Countdown, you'll start by adding the tracking code to your Teachery page as explained in Steps 1-3 at the beginning of this

2. Once you've added the tracking code, you'll need to add the URL of the page to your Funnel Steps in Deadline Funnel. This time select Inline Timer instead of Floating Bar, copy the code snippet provided, and hit 'Save':

3. Navigate back to your Teachery page and click on the section where you would like to add the Inline Timer, then select the HTML tab in the editing bar:
