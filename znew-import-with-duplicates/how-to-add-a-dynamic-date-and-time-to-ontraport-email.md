## How to Use Your Custom Field in Your Email

1. In the email editor, place the cursor where you want to add the dynamic date and time and click 'Insert Merge Field':

2. Scroll down and select your Deadline Funnel custom field that you selected when you set up your API integration \(we named ours 'Deadline Text'\):

3. This will insert your custom field placeholder into your email:

4. When you send yourself the email, you will see that the placeholder has been replaced with the deadline text format you chose in your setup. **NOTE** : You must send the actual email, the placeholder will not be replaced in a test message. You can send the email to yourself to test the delivery.
