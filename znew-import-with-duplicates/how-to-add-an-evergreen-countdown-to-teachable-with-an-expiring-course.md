# How to add an Evergreen Countdown to Teachable with an Expiring Course

Integrating your Teachable Sales Page with Deadline Funnel enables you to create an evergreen funnel offering access to your course for a limited time. Each deadline will be personalized on an individual basis, on an evergreen, rolling basis.

* Each deadline will be personalized on an individual basis
* When the deadline passes, Deadline Funnel will prevent leads from visiting your course page
* You can choose what URL to redirect visitors to after the deadline expires
