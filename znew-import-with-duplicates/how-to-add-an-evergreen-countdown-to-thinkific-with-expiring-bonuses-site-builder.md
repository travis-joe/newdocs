# How to Add an Evergreen Countdown to Thinkific with Expiring Bonuses \(newimport/Site Builder\)

Integrating your Thinkific Sales Page with Deadline Funnel enables you to create an evergreen funnel offeringlimited-time bonuses for each lead:

* Each deadline will be personalized on an individual basis
* Bonuses will only be available before the deadline
* The course will remain available on an evergreen, rolling basis

### Create Two Versions of your Thinkific Course

You will create 2 versions of your Thinkific course and sales page, 1 with the bonuses and 1 without the bonuses.

1. The duplicate course button can be found in the courses area of your Thinkific account. Click the 'Duplicate Course' icon:

Thinkific will ask you to verify that you want to duplicate the course, and will then send you an email when the duplication is complete.

2. Edit the duplicate version of your course to add your bonus content to the course and sales page. Be sure to name the 2 courses so that you know which course contains the bonuses
