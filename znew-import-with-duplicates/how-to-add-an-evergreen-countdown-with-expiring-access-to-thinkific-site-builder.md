# How to Add an Evergreen Countdown to Thinkific with an Expiring Course \(Site Builder\)

Integrating your Thinkific Sales Page with Deadline Funnel enables you to create an evergreen funnel offering access to your course for a limited time.

* The deadline will be personalized for each individual lead
* When the deadline passes, Deadline Funnel will prevent that leadleads from visiting your course page
* You can choose what URL to redirect a lead to after their deadline expires

## Integrate your Thinkific Course with Deadline Funnel:

1. Once you have created your course sales page using site builder, click 'Settings' and copy your course page URL:
