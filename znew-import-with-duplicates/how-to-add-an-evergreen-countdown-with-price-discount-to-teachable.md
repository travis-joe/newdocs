# How to add an Evergreen Countdown with Price Discount to Teachable

Integrating your Teachable Sales Page with Deadline Funnel enables you to create an evergreen funnel offering a **limited-time discount** for each lead. Each deadline will be personalized on an individual basis, offering an incentive to purchase, on an evergreen, rolling basis.

**Note:** Before you integrate the deadline with your Teachable page, you'll need to [create a campaign](https://documentation.deadlinefunnel.com/article/629-how-to-create-%20a-deadline-funnel-campaign).
