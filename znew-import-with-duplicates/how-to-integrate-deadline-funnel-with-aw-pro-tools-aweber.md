# How to Integrate Deadline Funnel with AW Pro Tools \(+ Aweber\)

This integration allows you to set up an evergreen campaign with a deadline for Aweber. Previously, you could only integrate Aweber via an Optin Form, but now you can add people who are already on your list as well.

## Set up the integration between AW Pro Tools and Deadline Funnel:

1. Click on API Integrations in the left menu, then select "I need to create a new API connection":
