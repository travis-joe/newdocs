**Note** : Make sure you are logged into your Deadline Funnel account before you begin.

1. Log into your LeadsBridge account

2. Create a new bridge, and select your source \(where the leads will be coming from - for example, ActiveCampaign\), and then select Deadline Funnel as the destination. ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5aea14822c7d3a3f981f31c0/file-Kr9nJkCrC5.png)

5. Select the email field from your source, so that Deadline Funnel will receive the subscriber email address and begin tracking for that subscriber: ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/53974d6ce4b0c76107b109d1/images/5aea152c2c7d3a3f981f31d4/file-KsKqSrFn2F.png) Once you activate your bridge, please test to make sure that leads are properly being sent from your source to the correct Deadline Funnel campaign. :\)
