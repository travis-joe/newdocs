### Before you get started

You need to create your evergreen Deadline Funnel Campaign. Set up your Deadline Funnel evergreen campaign based on the number of days between when someone _**attends**_ your webinar and the deadline for your promotion after the webinar. For example, if someone registers for your webinar on Monday, but attends your webinar on Tuesday, the deadline will start counting down on Tuesday.

We're here to help! Contact us on live chat \(bottom right corner of the screen\) Monday - Friday, 8am-4pm PST. Or you can shoot us an email any time at help@deadlinefunnel.com. ðŸ™‚
