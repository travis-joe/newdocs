## Important Note about Email Links

For this integration to work you MUST use the Deadline Funnel [email links](http://documentation.deadlinefunnel.com/article/16-expiring-links) in any of your emails that link to a sales page with a countdown timer, or that link to any page in your funnel that links to another page with your countdown timer.

In other words, the API integration requires that your subscribers click one of the Deadline Funnel email links before they reach a page with a countdown. This is necessary in order to make sure each subscriber is assigned the correct deadline.

If you have any questions, please let us know at [help@deadlinefunnel.com](mailto:mailto:help@deadlinefunnel.com).
