# How to Trigger a Countdown Upon Subscribe using Zapier

Zapier gives you the ability to use triggers to create different workflows which can make your business run more smoothly.

For this example, we will setup a trigger between Deadline Funnel and Kajabi, so that a countdown timer is started when someone joins a Kajabi list. **You can use any email service provider you choose, as long as they integrate with Zapier.**

**Note** : Make sure that you have already integrated your Zapier account with Deadline Funnel and your email service provider \(ESP\), and that you are logged into your Zapier account before you begin.

You can now test that the Zap is working by adding a new subscriber to your list in your email service provider and verifying that the subscriber's email has been added under Event Tracking in Deadline Funnel. Please note that there can be a slight delay between Zapier and Deadline Funnel, so if it doesn't show up right away, simply check back in five to ten minutes.

## Important Note about Email Links

For the integration to work you MUST use the Deadline Funnel [email links](http://documentation.deadlinefunnel.com/article/16-expiring-links) in any of your emails that link to a sales page with a countdown timer, or that link to a page in your funnel that links to another page with your countdown timer.

In other words, the API integration requires that your subscribers click one of the Deadline Funnel email links before they reach a page with a countdown. This is necessary in order to make sure each subscriber is assigned the correct deadline.
