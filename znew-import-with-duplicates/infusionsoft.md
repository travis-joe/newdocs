# Infusionsoft

## Getting Started

Deadline Funnel can help boost your sales for your marketing campaigns in Infusionsoft! ðŸ˜Ž

Each subscriber in your sequence will be automatically assigned their own custom deadline - whether you're doing a webinar... an email sequence... an automated launch... or really ANY type of campaign.

If you're not using a deadline you're leaving money on the table!

Here's a quick guide on how to get started with Deadline Funnel + Infusionsoft, so you can build your evergreen funnel.

**Deadline Funnel University:** Check out the [How to Create an Evergreen Email Funnel course](https://university.deadlinefunnel.com/courses/evergreen) on Deadline Funnel University for a free training series on building your first evergreen campaign!

## 1. Create your Deadline Funnel campaign

First things first - you will need to [create a campaign in Deadline Funnel](https://deadlinefunnel.com/promotions/create) before you can set up the integration with Infusionsoft.

When creating your campaign, we recommend selecting the blueprints option and then choose the "Email Sequence + Special Offer" blueprint:

Then you'll set the deadline length and add your first funnel step\(s\). Don't worry too much about those two items - you can come back later and change those at any time.

Once you've created your Deadline Funnel campaign, you will be taken to the Quick Start Guide, where you can verify that the correct trigger has been selected:

After you've created your Deadline Funnel campaign, [set up the integration between Deadline Funnel and Infusionsoft.](https://documentation.deadlinefunnel.com/article/292-how-to-%20integrate-deadline-funnel-with-infusionsoft)

This integration determines where you start each subscriber's Deadline Funnel tracking as they are going through your sequence.

## 3. Add Deadline Funnel email links to your sequence

Once the integration is up and running, any subscriber who goes through your sequence will start their Deadline Funnel tracking as soon as they reach the "HTTP post" in your sequence.

That's the first key part for Deadline Funnel tracking - tracking the email address of each subscriber as they go through your automation.

The second critical part for Deadline Funnel tracking is to add Deadline Funnel email links to the emails in your automation, wherever you're linking to a page that has a Deadline Funnel timer or redirect on it.

That would normally be your special offer page, which normally would get redirected to a different page after the deadline expires.

Please note that you cannot integrate Deadline Funnel + Infusionsoft correctly unless you add the DF links to your emails!

## Email timers and dynamic deadline text \(optional\)
